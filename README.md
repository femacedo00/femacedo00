## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Software Engineer driven by efficiency. I don't just build features; I re-engineer systems to be faster and more scalable.

With a strong Computer Science foundation built on **C** and **Python**, I spent the last 5 years mastering the **PHP** and **React** ecosystem to solve real-world business problems. My focus is on modernizing legacy architectures and optimizing performance—recently achieving a 25% speed increase in core platforms.

Currently, I am expanding my toolset with **Go (Golang)** to build high-concurrency solutions and robust backends.

**My philosophy:** Clean code, measurable results, and continuous evolution.
